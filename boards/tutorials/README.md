Tock Tutorial Boards and Kernel Definitions
===========================================

The boards in this folder are custom variants of the Tock kernel designed to
support the tutorials described in the
[Tock Book](https://book.tockos.org/course/course). We generally customize Tock
for hardware platforms we already have Tock support for in the tutorials, so if
you are looking for a more general purpose kernel, then using the main Tock
board for the hardware platform is probably better than using these. However,
if you are following one of the tutorials then using these pre-customized
kernel definitions makes it easier to get started.
